This is ev3ninja "NinjaStorms"
==============================

NinjaStorms is an attempt to create a simple RT Operating System for the Mindstorms EV3 Platform.

Getting Started:

  Edit the Makefile to reflect your system. In particular:
   - update SDDEV to the device your sd car FAT partition resides (e.g. /dev/sdd1)
   - update SDMNT to the mount point of your choice (e.g. /mnt/sd1)
   - (optional) update PREFIX to the prefix of your toolchain

  Make sure the right toolchain is installed and in your path - 
  we used to use CodeSourcery G++ Lite 2009q1-203, available from
   https://sourcery.mentor.com/GNUToolchain/release858
  
  but changed to a homebrew bare-metal toolchain generated by the script
   `build_toolchain.sh'
  located in the root directory of the repository.

  Compile the System by calling
   $> make

  And deploy on the Fat32 formatted sdcard by calling
   $> sudo make deploy

  Now, just boot the sdcard in the mindstorms, and watch the output of the serial console :)
