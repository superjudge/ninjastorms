This is ev3ninja "NinjaStorms"
==============================

NinjaStorms is an attempt to create a simple RT Operating System for the Mindstorms EV3 Platform.

Getting Started:

  Edit the Makefile to reflect your system. In particular:
   - update SDDEV to the device your sd car FAT partition resides (e.g. /dev/sdd1)
   - update SDMNT to the mount point of your choice (e.g. /mnt/sd1)

  Make sure the arm-none-linux-gnueabi- prefixed toolchain is installed and in your path - we use CodeSourcery G++ Lite 2009q1-203. You can get it here: https://sourcery.mentor.com/GNUToolchain/release858
  
  Compile the System by calling
   $> make

  And deploy on the Fat32 formatted sdcard by calling
   $> sudo make deploy

  Now, just boot the sdcard in the mindstorms, and watch the output of the serial console :)
